# Input Format
"""1.The first line of input will contain an integer 
T — the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
2.The first and only line of each test case contains two integers X and 
Y, as described in the problem statement."""
# Output Format
"""For each test case, output on a new line A if Alice is taller than Bob, else output B. 
The output is case insensitive, i.e, both A and a will be accepted as correct answers when Alice is taller."""
# Constraints ---- 1≤T≤1000 & 100≤X,Y≤200 & X≠Y
